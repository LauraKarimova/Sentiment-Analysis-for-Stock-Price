## General Information
> **Sentiment Analysis of Stocks from Financial News using Python**
> 
> Semantic analysis is a natural language processing technique that allows you to determine whether data is positive, neutral, or negative. Such analysis can be useful for tracking attitudes towards products or brands in customer reviews. Nowadays, customers have learned to openly express their thoughts and feelings, so semantic analysis has become an important tool for monitoring and understanding segments.
When it comes to the stock market, you can use sentiment analysis to analyze headlines about a particular stock. From this, you can tell if the price of a stock is moving in a positive or negative direction.
